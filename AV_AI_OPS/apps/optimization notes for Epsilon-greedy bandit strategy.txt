Strategy: epsilon_greedy (ε = 0.15)
Rooms in Scope: HQ-AUD-1, NYC-TH-2, EBC-EXEC-1
Mock Volume: ~36 briefings/week (≈12 per room)

Primary KPI: decision_reached
Secondary KPIs (guardrails): followup_booked, csat, engagement_proxy
Operational Guardrails:
  - csat ≥ 7.0 (rolling last 5 sessions)
  - issue_rate_per_100 ≤ baseline + 20%
  - join_latency_s ≤ baseline + 5s

Cold Start: first 10 sessions per recipe run as uniform split, then resume ε-greedy
Min Samples per Recipe Before Promotion: ≥ 25 sessions
Promotion Rule:
  - promote when decision_reached is ≥ +8% vs baseline AND no guardrail breaches for 1 week
  - sustain for an additional week before moving to 100% rollout

Change Limits: step changes ≤ 10% on lighting/audio levels; no more than 1 knob change per session
Risk: low–medium; rollback safe at any time via room preset “Baseline”

Data Capture:
  - Facilitator checklist after each briefing (decision_reached, followup_booked, csat 1–10)
  - Platform reports for join_latency_s; ops ticket tags for issue_rate_per_100
  - Tag ServiceNow Story with: EXP-EBR-2025Q1
  - Weekly Slack digest to #av-ops-pilot

Review Cadence: weekly (Mon)
Rollback Conditions:
  - csat < 7.0 for 3 consecutive sessions, OR
  - issue_rate_per_100 > baseline + 20%, OR
  - negative stakeholder feedback on experience quality

Room Overlay: HQ-AUD-1 — Lighting priority
Recipe Focus: CT 3800–4200K, Level 0.65–0.75, audience wash −10% during slides
Guardrail Addendum: avoid > 0.10 change in two consecutive sessions    

Room Overlay: NYC-TH-2 — Audio/Q&A priority
Recipe Focus: audience_mic_gain_db +3, expander_threshold −2 dB, autogate 2-speaker bias
Guardrail Addendum: rollback on any feedback_event or if csat_audio < 7.0   

Room Overlay: EBC-EXEC-1 — Presenter confidence
Recipe Focus: lectern mic +2 dB, camera preset “Presenter A” warm tint, audience wash −5% at slide start
Guardrail Addendum: maintain join_latency_s within +3s of baseline
